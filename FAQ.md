# Eudico FAQ
_Note: The aim of these FAQs is to get you started fast with Eudico so you can spawn a test network and start contributing to the code in no time. For more in depth documentation or further information about how to perform other actions go to the [Lotus documentation](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/set-up/about/), or refer to the base code. Eudico is a fork of Lotus, which means that "almost" everything that works in Lotus should work in Eudico out-of-the-box._

## Q: How to import a wallet?

**A:** Generate a key:
```
./lotus-keygen -t secp256k1
```
Import it (as default if needed):
```
./eudico wallet import –-as-default –-format=json-lotus $file
```

## Q: How to generate the cbor files when creating a new actor?

**A:** The Cbor library is used to help with marshalling and unmarshalling.
In the same folder where your `$actorName_actor.go` and `$actorName_state.go` files are defined, create a `gen` folder with a `gen.go` file that looks like [this](https://github.com/filecoin-project/eudico/blob/eudico/chain/consensus/hierarchical/actors/sca/gen/gen.go
). Add all the correspondings states and parameters, update the import url and add the package using `go get`. 
Pre-populate the functions of the interface in a `cbor_gen.go` file as follows:
```
func (t *$YourStruct) MarshalCBOR(w io.Writer) error { return nil }

func (t *$YourStruct) MarshalCBOR(w io.Writer) error { return nil }
```
Run  `go run gen.go`. 


## Q: How do you send a transaction directly from the code?
**A:** By using the `api-MpoolPushMessage.` See how to use it [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/eudico/blob/113829e7fc115daac08ea0217170baddcb7788ba/chain/consensus/hierarchical/subnet/manager/manager.go#L375-L391).

## Q: How can a built-in actor be initialize?
**A:** You can see an example of how is done for the SCA in [this piece of code](https://github.com/filecoin-project/eudico/blob/113829e7fc115daac08ea0217170baddcb7788ba/chain/consensus/hierarchical/actors/subnet/genesis.go#L131).

## Q: How can I run an eudico network with a specific consensus protocol?
**A:** Use the following commands:

Run a network:
 ```
 ./eudico delegated genesis $ADDR gen.gen
 ./eudico delegated daemon --genesis=gen.gen
 ```
 Run a miner:
 ```
 ./eudico wallet import --format=json-lotus $ADDR
 ./eudico delegated miner
 ```
 
## Q: How can I run two eudico peers on the same host?
**A:** Use a different `EUDICO_PATH` variable and `api` argument for each path.

Terminal 1:
```
export EUDICO_PATH="~/.eudico1/"
./eudico delegated daemon --genesis=gen.gen --api=1234
```

Terminal 2:
```
export EUDICO_PATH="~/.eudico2/"
./eudico delegated daemon --genesis=gen.gen --api=1235
```

## Q: How can two two eudico clients be connected with each other?
**A:** Suppose you have two eudico clients A and B. Run the following commands:

On client A run the command below to output the target's libp2p address, `ADDR_A` 
```
./eudico net listen
```

Run on client B:
```
./eudico net connect ADDR_A
```
